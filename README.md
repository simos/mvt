# Mobile Verification Toolkit

[![](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/mvt)](https://pypi.org/project/mvt/)

Mobile Verification Toolkit (MVT) is a collection of utilities to simplify and automate the process of gathering forensic traces helpful to identify a potential compromise of Android and iOS devices.

It has been developed and released by the [Amnesty International Security Lab](https://www.amnesty.org/en/tech/) in July 2021 in the context of the [Pegasus project](https://forbiddenstories.org/about-the-pegasus-project/) along with [a technical forensic methodology and forensic evidences](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2021/07/forensic-methodology-report-how-to-catch-nso-groups-pegasus/).

*Warning*: this tool has been released as a forensic tool for a technical audience. Using it requires some technical skills such as understanding basics of forensic analysis and using command line tools.

[Please check out the documentation.](https://mvt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)


## Installation

MVT can be installed from sources or conveniently using:

`pip3 install mvt`

You will need some dependencies, so please check the [documentation](https://mvt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).

Alternatively, you can decide to run MVT and all relevant tools through a [Docker container](https://mvt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docker.html)

## License

The purpose of MVT is to facilitate the ***consensual forensic analysis*** of devices of those who might be targets of sophisticated mobile spyware attacks, especially members of civil society and marginalized communities. We do not want MVT to enable privacy violations of non-consenting individuals. Therefore, the goal of this license is to prohibit the use of MVT (and any other software licensed the same) for the purpose of *adversarial forensics*.

In order to achieve this, MVT is released under an adaptation of [Mozilla Public License v2.0](https://www.mozilla.org/MPL). This modified license includes a new clause 3.0, "Consensual Use Restriction" which permits the use of the licensed software (and any *"Larger Work"* derived from it) exclusively with the explicit consent of the person/s whose data is being extracted and/or analysed (*"Data Owner"*).
